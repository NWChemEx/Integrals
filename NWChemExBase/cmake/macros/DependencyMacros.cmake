# Macro for finding a dependency that is presumed built.  It is assumed that
# whatever name is given
# to this macro, is a name that can be directly fed to CMake's find_package
# macro.  Furthermore it is assumed that the result is given back as the
# standard variables, e.g.
# XXX_INCLUDE_DIRS, XXX_LIBRARIES, etc. where XXX is the name of the library in
# all capital letters.
#
# Syntax: find_dependency(<name> <include> <lib> <flags> <required>)
#    - name     : The name to be passed to find_package
#    - include  : The variable to append the includes on to
#    - lib      : The variable to append the libraries on to
#    - flags    : The variable to append the compile-time flags on to
#    - required : REQUIRED or QUIET will be passed to find_package
#
