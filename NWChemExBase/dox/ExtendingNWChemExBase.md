Preliminaries
-------------

For its "build" system NWChemExBase uses CMake.  The main assets of CMake is it
provides a nicer syntax than make, provides robust cross-platform builds, and it
is widely supported.  Technically speaking CMake is a build system generator,
which has important ramifications discussed below.  For now, realize that there 
really are four phases to a CMake build: 
1. Configuration phase 
   - The "true" CMake step
   - CMake generates the build files 
2. Build phase
   - Build files are consumed by a build program (typically by make)
   - Build program invokes compiler, linker, archiver to form compiled code
3. Test phase 
   - Products made in build phase are tested
   - CMake provides a utility CTest that makes this step easy for CMake projects
4. Install phase
   - Handled by the build program
   - Verified build products are put in their final resting places
Technically speaking CMake defines several other phases, but we ignore them 
for simplicity.  Regardless of which phase you want to influence the details 
of what to do will be provided to CMake via configuration files, which by 
default have the name `CMakeLists.txt`.  Typically, there is one of these per 
directory.  Each of these configuration files describes what is to be done with
the contents of that directory during each of the four aforementioned 
phases.  These files are written using the CMake language, the syntax of 
which, is reminiscent of a Linux shell script.  The remainder of this section
will aim to acquaint you with the CMake language. 


You can define and print variables like:

~~~cmake
#Comments start with #'s
#This sets a variable name use_library to true
set(use_library TRUE)
  
message(STATUS "The value of use_library is: ${use_library}")
  
#Note that CMake's variables are case-sensitive, so this
message(STATUS "The value of use_library is: ${USE_LIBRARY}")
#will print "The value of use_library is: "
~~~

Admittedly CMake's variables are more complex then they first seem.
~~~cmake
#Sets the variable a_value to /some/path
set(a_value /some/path)
  
#Sets the variable a_value to the string /some/path
set(a_value "/some/path")

#Sets the variable many_values to the list [/some/path,/another/path]
set(many_values /some/path /another/path)

#Sets the variable many_values to the list[/some/path,/another/path]
set(many_values "/some/path;/another/path")

#Sets the variable many_values the string "/some/path /another/path"
set(many_values "/some/path /another/path")
~~~
So why does the string vs. list thing matter?
~~~cmake
set(my_list arg1 arg2)
set(my_string "arg1 arg2")
some_fxn(${my_list}) # Same as some_fxn(arg1 arg2) i.e. passing two args
some_fxn(${my_string}) #Same as some_fxn("arg1 arg2") i.e. passing a single arg
~~~
Thus the difference is important for grouping.  Consequently, one common mistake
is to forward a list to a function when you really want to pass all the 
arguments as one argument (particularly relevant when passing compiler flags and
paths).

CMake supports basic control flow options like loops:
~~~cmake
foreach(x ${SOME_LIST})
   message(STATUS "Current element of list is: ${x}")
endforeach()
~~~
and if-statements:
~~~cmake
if(use_library)
   #Do something that requires the library
elseif(NOT use_library)
   #Do something in the event we aren't using that library
else()
   #Not sure how we get here...
endif()
~~~
It should be noted that the rules of if statements are weird in that it will
automatically dereference the value.  This is easier to grasp by example:

~~~cmake  
set(value1 FALSE)
set(value2 "value1")
if(value2)
  #Auto deref value2 gives string  "value1" which is not false
  message(STATUS "This will be printed")
elseif(${value2})
  #Deref of value2 happens first, if then derefs "value1" obtaining FALSE
  message(STATUS "This will not be printed")
endif()
~~~

:memo: `if(value2 AND ${value3})` will result in a cmake error if no variable
value3 is defined or if it is defined as empty/empty string.  Deref of value2 
gives a non-empty value as mentioned above, while deref of value3 gives empty
if not defined.


To check if a variable is defined, use: `if(DEFINED variable_name)`.

You can look for a particular dependency with:
~~~cmake
#CMake will crash if it doesn't find blas
find_package(BLAS REQUIRED)
  
#This is an error because find_package is case-sensitive
find_package(blas REQUIRED)
  
#This will find LAPACK, but not note that it did
find_package(LAPACK QUIET)
~~~

There are many more CMake commands, options, (and pitfalls) but for the most 
part you'll be interacting with them via the NWChemExBase API, which modifies 
those commands.  The rest of this page will get you acquainted with the 
NWChemExBase workflow.

Superbuild Basics
-----------------

Let us assume that our main project has dependencies.  Furthermore, let us also
assume that we are good software scientists and do not simply always build 
said dependencies without giving the user a chance to provide them to us. It 
then follows that we need a mechanism for finding, and then possibly building
these dependencies.  As mentioned CMake provides `find_package` specifically 
for this purpose.  Our last assumption is that in an effort to strive for 
uniformity we will only use `find_package` to locate dependencies.  Although we
took quite some time to lay out these assumptions they are quite basic from a
build perspective.  Somewhat surprising these innocent enough assumptions are
quite problematic for CMake owing to the separation between configure and 
build.   Given that these are common assumptions, its perhaps unsurprising 
that a CMake pattern has emerged for working within them.  The pattern is 
termed the superbuild pattern. The hallmark of which is that the build is 
driven by an additional build on top of it.  Practically speaking this amounts
to ensuring all CMake projects and dependencies are brought into the build via
the `ExternalProject_Add` mechanism. 

### Why a Superbuild?

To better understand why we need a superbuild consider a simple example.  Assume
you are building library B, which depends on some external library A.  You 
start off by looking for A.  As mentioned, CMake provides a function 
`find_package` specifically for this reason.  Let's say `find_package` 
finds A. Great, you simply compile B against the A found by CMake.  What if 
CMake doesn't find it? There's two options:
1. Crash, tell the user to build A, have user rerun CMake.
   - Basically the same as the prior scenario at this point
2. You can attempt to build A yourself.  
Wanting to be user friendly, you add an optional target that will build A if 
it's not found.  As alluded to, CMake provides a command 
`ExternalProject_Add` specifically for this purpose.  `ExternalProject_Add` 
will add some steps to the build phase that will build A.  The problem is 
that this means A won't be built (and therefore findable) until the build 
phase.  Thus all `find_package` calls in B will still fail as `find_package` 
happens during B's configuration phase (and A hasn't been built yet).  
 
As mentioned the solution is to tell CMake about B via `ExternalProject_Add`.
This is because, like it did for A, this command will add steps to the build
phase that will configure, build, test, and install A.  Furthermore, because of
the dependency between A and B, CMake will ensure that A is built first.  
Thus when B's configure step runs `find_package` will be able to find A. 

### Anatomy of a Superbuild

Building on what we just described the superbuild process proceeds via:  

1. The "configure" phase so far as CMake knows  
   a. Establish dependencies among projects  
   b. Determine dependencies that need built.  
2. The "build" phase according to CMake  
   1.  Build dependencies
       1. Configure phase for dependency
       2. Build phase for dependency
       3. Install dependency to staging area
   2.  Build main project
       1. Configure phase for main project
       2. Build phase for main project
       3. Install main project to staging area
   3.  Build tests for main project
       1. Configure phase for tests  
       2. Build phase for tests
       3. Install tests to test staging area
3. Test the main project
4. Install the main project to real install location

Looking only at the outermost bullets you can see to the outside world the
build looks normal.  This is important as it allows CMake projects relying on a
superbuild to be subprojects of other CMake projects (which themselves may
possibly be superbuilds).

Superbuild Technical Details
----------------------------

### Staging the Build

During the build phase each dependency has the whole gamut of phases run on it
including the install phase.  When invoking CMake on the entire project the 
user set the variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (or if they didn't it defaulted 
to something like `/usr/local`).  This is the root of the path into 
which all products are to be installed (*e.g.* libraries would be installed 
to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib` and headers to 
`${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include`).  If we simply let each dependency install
 itself there's the possibility (particularly if the user didn't specify 
 `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`) that the build phase would then try to install into 
 a place like `/usr/local`, which requires administrator privileges.  It is 
 generally considered a bad idea to run any part of the build process, with the
 exception of the install phase, with elevated privileges (poorly written or 
 maliciously written builds would then have the ability to wreck hell on your
 system; install just copies files so if they built ok it's more likely that 
 they won't screw up your system).  The solution is simple, during the build
 phase we create a directory `STAGE_DIR` that will focus as the effective root
 of the file system for the duration of the build and testing phases.  All 
 dependencies and projects are then installed to paths like 
 `${STAGE_DIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib`.  Tests are then run on the staged
 version of the project.  Finally, during the install phase we just copy the
 contents of `${STAGE_DIR}` to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}`.
 
 ### RPATHs
 
 When using a superbuild RPATHs become significantly more complicated.  This is
 because of the staging step.  Basically we need two RPATHs: one for the 
 staging directory that is used during the testing phase, and one for the actual
 install phase.
 
 *Expand on this section when RPATHs are more stable*

### Target Names

If you look at `NWChemExBase/CMakeLists.txt` you'll notice that we put a suffix
on all target names.  CMake (and the underlying build programs) prohibit two 
targets from having the same name.  In particular it is quite natural for say
library A to name its target A.  `ExternalProject_Add` command 
introduces a new namespace (targets defined within the `ExternalProject_Add` 
are not visible to the caller of the `ExternalProject_Add` and vice versa) so if
while building library A, it uses CMake and declares a target A, it will not 
affect the superbuild.  The problem comes in when we call `find_package` (say
in preparing another dependency).  In this scenario, particularly if 
`find_package` finds the package via its `XXXConfig.cmake` file, it is likely
that another target will be produced (to aid in you in linking).  This 
additional target will not be namespace protected and may collided with our 
targets.  To avoid this we append a suffix that we expect to be unique. 

:memo: The convention is to append `_External` to each target.


NWChemExBase Model
------------------

Drawing on years of experience writing `CMakeLists.txt` files there is a lot of
boiler-plate to them.  The primary goal of NWChemExBase is to take care of this
boiler-plate for you in a customizable and robust manner.  To that end, it is
far easier to accomplish this mission if we make some basic assumptions.

Given the details in the Superbuild section we have modeled our directory 
layout after the flow of the Superbuild.  Ultimately, we assume your project 
source tree is setup like:

~~~
ProjectRoot/
├──CMakeLists.txt
├──NWChemExBase/
├──ProjectName/
|  └──CMakeLists.txt
└──ProjectName_Test/
    └──CMakeLists.txt
~~~
 
You are free to have additional folders and files, but they are not required for
the purposes of using NWChemExBase.  It should be noted that the folder 
`NWChemExBase` is a clone of the `NWChemExBase` repo (preferably as a git 
subrepo so that it can be updated as the need occurs).  Assuming you are using
git, `ProjectRoot` would be the root directory of your repo and the directory
users of your library clone.  So far as the outside world is concerned it is
your project.  Directly inside this folder are the configuration instructions 
for the superbuild (the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` and much of 
`NWChemExBase/`) as well as the recipes for the dependencies (in 
`NWChemExBase/`).  The folder `ProjectName` is, from the perspective of the 
superbuild, your project (this is why we don't name it `src/`; *i.e.* typically 
the more canonical folders like `include/`, `src/`, `share/`, *etc.* will live
inside this folder).  Realizing that tests can be thought of as a set of 
libraries or executables that depend on you library they are elevated to 
the same rank as your project (so as to also be included via the 
`ExternalProject_Add` mechanism).

:memo: `ProjectName` and `ProjectName_Test` are the default folder names 
derived from the CMake variable `PROJECT_NAME`, which you will set in the 
top-level `CMakeLists.txt`.  If you don't like these names for some reason, 
we have provided the advanced options `NWX_SRC_DIRS` and `NWX_TEST_DIRS` which
can be respectively set to what you decided to call your "source" and test
directories. 

:memo: CMake is really written for your directory structure to match you 
build structure.  This is largely an artifact of directory boundaries 
defining scopes.  Although it is in theory possible to lay the project out in
a different manner, doing so is an uphill battle and not particularly easy to 
automate.


### Superbuild Settings

The file `ProjectRoot/CMakeLists.txt` is the root `CMakeLists.txt` file and is
used as the entry point for CMake into your project and to tell NWChemExBase the
details of the superbuild.  It should be quite minimal, likely only including:
~~~cmake
#What version of CMake includes all your used features? Try to stick to 3.1
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
  
#Details about your project including:
# ProjectName : the name of your project used throughout the build.  It is case
#               sensitive
# a.b.c       : The major, minor, and patch versions of your project
project(ProjectName VERSION a.b.c LANGUAGES CXX) #Change a.b.c
  
#This line is considered input to NWChemExBase and tells it a list of external
#dependencies that your project depends on.  The name of the variable must be
#the case-sensitive project name supplied above followed by "_LIBRARY_DEPENDS" 
#in that exact case.  The ellipses would then be replaced by a list of external
#dependencies that your project needs.  The names of which must be valid
#find_package identifiers (a list is below)
set(ProjectName_LIBRARY_DEPENDS ...)
  
# Turn control over to NWChemExBase
add_subdirectory(NWChemExBase)
~~~

#### Declaring Your Library

The actual declaration of your library goes in 
`ProjectRoot/ProjectName/CMakeLists.txt`.  It is here you will specify the
 source files that need compiled, the headers that need installed, and any flags
 required to compile the source files.  Your library will automatically be
 linked to whatever dependencies you requested.

~~~cmake
#Set version off of top-level variable
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${CMAKE_VERSION})
  
#Should be same as root `CMakeLists.txt` aside from needing the "-SRC" postfix
project(ProjectName-SRC VERSION 0.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)
  
#This will allow us to use the nwchemex_add_library command  
include(TargetMacros)

#Strictly speaking the following three variables can have whatever name you want
#as they will be passed to the nwchemex_add_library macro
  
#We create a list of all the source files (paths relative to this file)
set(ProjectName_SRCS ...)
  
#...a list of all header files that are part of the public API (*i.e.* need 
#to be installed with the library)
set(ProjectName_INCLUDES ...)
  
#...and a list of any compile flags/definitions to provide the library
set(ProjectName_DEFINITIONS ...)
  
#Finally we tell NWChemExBase to make a library ProjectName (the end name will
#be postfix-ed properly according to library type) using the specified sources,
#flags, and public API
nwchemex_add_library(ProjectName ProjectName_SRCS 
                                 ProjectName_INCLUDES
                                 ProjectName_DEFINITIONS
                                 )
~~~

### Declaring Your Tests


The file `ProjectRoot/ProjectName_Test/CMakeLists.txt` will control the tests 
for your library.  By default the `Catch` C++ testing library will be visible to
your tests.  Simply include `#include catch/catch.hpp` in your test's source
file to use it.

~~~cmake
#Set version based off top-level variable
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${CMAKE_VERSION})
  
#Should be same as root `CMakeLists.txt` aside from needing the "-Test" prefix
project(ProjectName-Test VERSION 0.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)
  
#This will find your staged library (a ProjectNameConfig.cmake file was
#automatically generated for you during the build)  
find_package(ProjectName REQUIRED)
  
#Pull our testing macros into scope
include(TargetMacros)
  
#Add a test that lives in a file Test1.cpp and depends on the target ProjectName
add_cxx_unit_tests(Test1 ProjectName)
  
#Add additional tests...
~~~

At the moment we currently only have macros for adding C++ unit tests.  Other
languages and test types will be added as needed.

### Known Limitations

As you can imagine distilling a complex thing like a build down to a few
customizable options incurs some limitations.  At the moment these are:

- Can only specify one library.
  - Limitation can be avoided by nesting superbuilds for each library 
- No support for restricting the version of a found library
  - Needs fixed, will happen before a 1.0 release


Finding Dependencies
--------------------

*N.B.* in this section `<Name>` is the name of a package as passed to 
`find_package` and `<NAME>` is the name of that package in all uppercase.  

CMake provides the `find_package` function for finding dependencies.  
Unfortunately, much of how this function works relies on naming conventions.  By
convention `find_package(<Name>)` is supposed to set minimally three variables:

1. `<NAME>_FOUND`        : Set to true if the package `<Name>` was found.
                           Unfortunately CMake does not specify the state of
                           this variable in the event it is not found.
2. `<NAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS` : All paths that a user of `<Name>` will need to 
                           include (`<Name>`'s headers and its dependencies)
3. `<NAME>_LIBRARIES`    : Same as `<NAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS1 except for libraries to 
                           link against                      
Optionally a package may set:

4. `<NAME>_DEFINITIONS`  : List of definitions and flags to use while compiling
5. `<Name>_FOUND`        : `find_package` expects a variable of the same case
                           back.  Setting this is needed for it to properly use
                           the REQUIRED keyword.                                        

Of course, many packages do not adhere to these standards complicating
automation.  Currently our solution is to write `FindNWX_<Name>.cmake` files
for packages not adhering to them and to prefer our projects us the *NWX* 
versions instead of the normal ones.

Enabling Additional Dependencies
--------------------------------

It is likely inevitable that additional dependencies will occur.  When this
happens the primary responsibility of maintainers is to ensure that a dependency
can be found by `find_package`.  This can happen in two ways:

1. If the dependency uses CMake (correctly) already it will generate a 
   `XXXConfig.cmake` file (typically in install/root/share/cmake) which 
   `find_package` can use to pull the dependency in.
2. You will have to write a `FindXXX.cmake` file for it.

The first scenario is ideal and means you don't have to do any work to ensure
CMake can find the dependency (if you want your dependency to be installable in
an automated fashion you'll still have work to do though).  The second scenario
requires work on our end.

### Writing a FindXXX.cmake File

First off let's discuss capitalization as it plays a key role here.  By default
when you call `find_package(aBc)` it will look for a file `FindaBc.cmake` that 
is the case is preserved.  Barring finding that it will look for 
`aBcConfig.cmake` or `abc-config.cmake`; however, we're assuming the config 
files do not exist.  Anyways, after calling `FindaBc.cmake`, `find_package` will
determine if `aBC` was found by considering the results of the variable 
`aBC_FOUND` (note the case always matches the case given to `find_package`). 
Lastly, making matters worse, it is convention to always return variables 
(aside from the `aBc_FOUND` variable) in all uppercase letters (it's a good idea
to return `aBc_FOUND` both in the native case and in all caps).

Case caveats aside, let's say we want to do this in a textbook manner, then the 
resulting `FindaBc.cmake` file should look something like:

~~~cmake
#File FindaBc.cmake
#
# By convention this file will set the following:
#
# aBc_FOUND        to true if all parts of the aBc package are found
# ABC_INCLUDE_DIR  to the path for includes part of aBc's public API
# ABC_LIBRARY      to the libraries included with aBc
# ABC_INCLUDE_DIRS will be the includes of aBc as well as any dependency it
#                  needs
# ABC_LIBRARIES    will be the libraries of aBc and all its dependencies
# ABC_DEFINITIONS  will be any compile-time flags to use in your project
                   
  
#Call find_package for each dependency
find_package(Depend1)
  
#Try to piggy-back of package-config 
find_package(PkgConfig)
pkg_check_modules(PC_ABC <libname_without_suffix>)
  
#For each header file in the public API try to find it
find_path(ABC_INCLUDE_DIR <path/you/put/in/cxx/source/file>
          HINTS ${PC_ABC_INCLUDEDIR} ${PC_ABC_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
  
#For each library try to find it
find_path(ABC_LIBRARY <library/name/including/the/lib/and/the/extension>)
          HINTS ${PC_ABC_LIBDIR} ${PC_ABC_LIBRARY_DIRS}
)
  
#Let CMake see see if the found values are sufficient
include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
find_package_handle_standard_args(aBc DEFAULT_MSG ABC_INCLUDE_DIR ABC_LIBRARY)
  
#In examples you'll see a marked_as_advanced line here a lot, but it's pretty
#useless as barely anyone runs the cmake GUI...
  
#Add dependencies and aBc's includes to ABC_INCLUDE_DIRS
set(ABC_INCLUDE_DIRS ${ABC_INCLUDE_DIR} ...)
  
#Same for libraries to link to
set(ABC_LIBRARIES ${ABC_LIBRARY} ...)
  
#Set the flags needed to compile against aBc
set(ABC_DEFINITIONS ...)
~~~
Once written your file goes in `NWChemBase/cmake/external_find/FindaBc.cmake`

### Enabling NWChemExBase to Build a Dependency

In an effort to make the build process more user-friendly it is common to want
to build dependencies for the user.  That is, if we are unable to locate a
required dependency on the system, we instead build it.  CMake doesn't have a
particular convention for how this done so we have taken the liberty of defining
a process for you.  We assume the following is in 
`NWChemExBase/cmake/external_build/BuildXXX.cmake`.

~~~cmake
#include(ExternalProject) and include(DependancyMacros) are already sourced

ExternalProject_Add(XXX_External #Target name = file name plus _External suffix
  <Rest of settings> 
)

#For each dependency flag it as one
foreach(__depend <list of dependencies>)
    find_or_build_dependency(${__depend})
    #The external target was made for you by find_or_build_dependency
    set_dependencies(XXX_External ${__depend}_External)
endforeach()    
~~~

### Supported Dependencies

These are dependencies that NWChemExBase currently knows how to find:

| Name            | Brief Description                                          |  
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------- |  
| MPI             | MPI compilers, includes, and libraries                     | 
| OpenMP          | Determines the flags for compiling/linking to OpenMP       |  

Following are dependencies that NWChemExBase will build for you if it cannot find them:

| Name            | Brief Description                                          |  
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------- |  
| Eigen3          | The Eigen C++ matrix library                               |
| GTest           | Google's testing framework                                 |
| NWX_Catch       | Catch testing framework installed our way                  |
| LibInt          | Computes Gaussian integrals for quantum mechanics          |
| GlobalArrays    | The Global Arrays distributed matrix library               |
| AntlrCppRuntime | The ANTLR grammar parsing library                          |

The following dependencies have to be specified. Alternatively, an option can also
be specified to NWChemExBase to build the Netlib versions for you. 

| Name            | Brief Description                                          |
