Example Mainpage
----------------

This is an example mainpage.  It is the first page readers of your documentation
will see.  You should make it nice and pretty, probably with links to various
topics.

- [Link to README that works on GitHub](README.md)
- [Link to README that works in Doxygen](@ref md_README)

As you see (assuming you're looking at the source file) it is written in
markdown.  This is a cool feature because it means GitHub will display this page
without having to link to the HTML generated by Doxygen.  Unfortunately the 
linking between documents is a somewhat fickle thing.  In order to get the links
to work on GitHub the paths to the files need to be relative paths from the 
current file.  In theory, Doxygen supports paths as well, the caveat being that
paths need to be relative to the location from which Doxygen was called.  In 
practice, the only reliable way I've found is to use a Doxygen specific markdown
extension `@ref md_<Name of File Without .md>`.  Thus at this time it seems the
documentation will only be indexed correctly either for Doxygen or for GitHub, 
but not both.  *N.B.* It appears that the relative path issue has been fixed in
a newer version of Doxygen; however, that is not the version used by CodeDocs.
